Sure, here are some logical problems involving arrays, objects, and strings that you can use to study JavaScript:

Arrays:

Sum of Array Elements: Write a function that calculates the sum of all elements in an array of numbers.

Find Maximum and Minimum: Create a function to find the maximum and minimum values in an array of numbers.

Array Reversal: Write a function to reverse an array without using the built-in reverse() method.

Array Filtering: Create a function that filters out all even numbers from an array of integers.

Array Flattening: Write a function that takes a nested array and returns a flattened version.

Array Intersection: Implement a function that finds the common elements between two arrays.

Array Rotation: Create a function that rotates the elements of an array by a given number of positions.

Objects:

Object Keys and Values: Write a function that takes an object and returns an array of its keys and an array of its values.

Object Deep Comparison: Implement a deep equality function that checks if two objects have the same properties and values, even if they are nested.

Object Transformation: Write a function that converts an array of objects into a single object, using a specified property as the key.

Object Filtering: Create a function that takes an object and a filter function and returns a new object with only the properties that satisfy the filter.

Object Mapping: Implement a function that maps a function over all the values in an object, producing a new object.

Strings:

Palindrome Check: Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

String Reversal: Create a function that reverses a string without using the built-in reverse() method.

Anagram Detection: Implement a function that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.

String Compression: Write a function that compresses a string by replacing repeated characters with the character followed by the count.

String Manipulation: Implement a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.

String Rotation Check: Create a function that determines if one string is a rotation of another string.
