pure component (in this case, a pure function that returns a React component that renders the same output every time it is called with the same input)

list & keys (a key is a unique value for each list item that is used to identified, update or remove an item by React)

diffing algorithm (a diffing algorithm that compares two trees and returns the minimal set of operations needed to transform the first tree into the second tree, virtual DOM)

react app performance (if we want to improve the performance of our React app, we can use some techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization to improve the performance of our app, which can be done by using the following techniques: useCallback and useMemo hooks) 

custom hook (a custom hook is a function that allows you to reuse state and other React features in your component without writing a class or extending React.Component)

send the data from child to parent 
    (useEffect vs useLayoutEffect
    useLayoutEffect : it runs after the DOM is rendered, but before the component is rendered in the browser. It is used for running side effects in React.
    useEffect : it runs after the DOM is rendered and before the component is rendered in the browser. It is used for running side effects in React.
    )
drawbacks of CSR (Client Side Rendering the main drawbacks are : initial loading is slow, server side rendering is slow, it is not SEO friendly, it is not user friendly)

drawbacks of useMemo and React.memo in a simpler form:
    (
        Complexity: Using these features can make your code harder to understand.
        Memory Usage: They might use more memory, especially if memoized values are large.
        False Positives: They might unnecessarily store values, wasting memory.
        Performance Issues: In some cases, they could slow down your app instead of speeding it up.
        Compatibility: They work best with certain types of data and functions.
        Debugging Difficulty: Finding and fixing issues related to memoization can be tricky.
        Maintenance: As your app changes, you might need to adjust your memoization, which can take time and effort.
    )

useMemo:
    Purpose: It's like a memory saver for functions. It remembers the result of a function so that if you call it again with the same inputs, it gives you the remembered result instead of recalculating.
    Limitations:
    It might not always remember everything perfectly.
    It may not always keep things neat and tidy, especially if the function has side effects.
React.memo:
    Purpose: It's like a speed booster for components. It remembers how a component renders based on its props, so if the props don't change, it doesn't re-render the component.
    Limitations:
    It might miss some things while remembering, especially if the component isn't pure.
    It might not always catch all changes if the component has side effects.

react portals ( React Portal is a feature that allows you to render a React component tree outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. In other words, it lets you render elements at a different place in the DOM tree from where the parent component is rendered.)

role based authorization (
    Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It answers the question, "Who are you?" Common methods of authentication include username/password authentication, biometric authentication, OAuth, etc. Once a user is authenticated, they are given a token or session that identifies them within the system.
    Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access after they have been authenticated. It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?" Authorization is typically based on the user's identity and their associated permissions or roles. Role-based authorization is one approach to managing authorization, where access control decisions are based on the roles assigned to users.

recurise function to print multiples of a given number (')
event loop & code execution
    (
        event loop is the process of executing JavaScript code in a single thread. It is a mechanism that allows JavaScript code to be scheduled and executed in the order that it was written.
        code execution is the process of executing JavaScript code in a single thread. It is a mechanism that allows JavaScript code to be scheduled and executed in the order that it was written.
    )

    ()
aggregate queries involving multiple stages
    (
        in Mongodb aggregation is a type of data Read operations in this method we can possible to perform multiple type of stages like match, group, project, sort and limit.
        after we will get some 
    )
user agent (
    in nodejs we can get information about the browser and operating system of the user
)

express.json & urlencoded (
    express.json is a middleware that parses incoming requests convert in to JSON format.
    urlencoded :URL encoding is a method used to convert data into a format that can be transmitted over the internet. URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) can only contain a limited set of characters, so any characters outside of this set must be encoded to ensure they are transmitted properly.
                URL encoding works by replacing non-alphanumeric characters with a "%" followed by their ASCII hexadecimal representation. 
)

query param & path params - usecases(
        Path Parameters:
            Path parameters are used to identify a specific resource within a URL path.
            They are part of the URL path itself and typically come after the base URL and endpoint.
            They are denoted by a colon (:) followed by the parameter name in the URL path.
            Path parameters are often used to retrieve a specific resource or perform operations on a resource identified by a unique identifier.
            Example: In the URL /users/:userId, :userId is a path parameter representing the unique identifier of a user.
        Query Parameters:
            Query parameters are used to provide additional information to the server as key-value pairs.
            They are appended to the end of a URL after a question mark (?), and multiple parameters are separated by ampersands (&).
            Query parameters are not part of the URL path but rather are appended as a string at the end of the URL.
            They are often used for filtering, sorting, or specifying options in a request.
            Example: In the URL /search?q=keyword&page=1, q and page are query parameters representing the search keyword and page number, respectively.
)

    Disadvantages: limited storage domein have 5mb to 10mb ,domain specific spaces, no encryption, blocking 
)

        yield 2
        yield 3
    }
    const iterator = gen();

    console.log(iterator.next().value); // Output: 1
    console.log(iterator.next().value); // Output: 2
    console.log(iterator.next().value); // Output: 3
    console.log(iterator.next().value)
)

Weakset (WeakSet is a collection of objects, where each object may only occur once within the set. Unlike regular sets, weak sets do not prevent objects from being garbage-collected if they are not referenced elsewhere in the program. This means that if an object is added to a WeakSet, and there are no other references to that object, it may be garbage-collected.)

Weakmap (WeakMap is also a object when we adding an object to it, it has 2 properties : 1. key 2. value)

Object.seal (
    it is object method it is mainly used to prevent the new keys while the object is sealed.
    in this method we can possible to update the existing key's values
)

)

threadpool (
    threadpool is a mechanism that allows multiple tasks to be executed in parallel.
    it handling the treads, 
)

event driven programming (
    in a program are triggered by events. These events could be things like when a user clicks a button or types on a keyboard, or when data is received from a network. Instead of following a fixed sequence of steps, the program reacts to events as they happen.
)
spawn (
    spawning usually refers to the creation of child processes using Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js provides the child_process module, which allows you to spawn new processes and communicate with them.

Hashed indexing( hashed indexing refers to the process of creating an index using a hash function on one or more fields in a collection. This type of indexing allows for efficient queries based on equality matches but does not support range-based queries.)
TTL index
database profiler( database profiler is a diagnostic tool that collects detailed information about the operations performed on a MongoDB instance. It helps administrators and developers analyze the performance of queries, commands, and write operations executed against the database.)
covered query( index-covered query or index-only query, is a type of query in MongoDB where all the fields specified in the query are part of an index, and MongoDB can fulfill the query solely by accessing the index without having to examine any documents.)

Aggregate practicsls

segment tree (data structure used for efficiently answering range queries and updating values in an array. It is particularly useful for operations like finding the sum, minimum, maximum, or other aggregate values within a specified range of indices in the array.)
double hashing (is a technique used in hash tables to resolve collisions that occur when two different keys hash to the same index. It involves applying a second hash function to the original key to compute an alternate index, which can then be used to find an available slot in the hash table.)
load factor (
    load factor is a measure of how full the hash table is. It's typically expressed as the ratio of the number of stored elements (or keys) to the total number of slots in the hash table. The load factor helps determine when to resize the hash table to maintain performance.
    The load factor is calculated using the following formula:Load Factor= Number of Stored Elements/ Total Number of Slots )

monotonic stack (that maintains a specific ordering property of its elements. In a monotonic stack, the elements are either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing from bottom to top.)
Serialize a binary tree (converting the tree structure into a string representation that can be stored or transmitted and later reconstructed back into the original tree structure. One common approach to serialize a binary tree is to use a preorder traversal (root-left-right) and represent each node as a string containing its value. Null nodes are represented by a special character to indicate absence.)
Tarjan’s algorithm ( is used to find strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph)
double ended queue (we can perform the enqueue and dequeue in the both side in noraml queue we can only possible to do the front side )
linear probing (is a collision resolution technique used in hash tables to handle collisions when two different keys hash to the same index or bucket. Instead of immediately storing the collided element in the same bucket, linear probing searches for the next available (unoccupied) bucket in the hash table to store the collided element.)
quadratic probing (it check the next probing possition for add this key value )
Open addressing ( it is the main probing handling technique that's are linear, quadratic, double hasing techniques )

suffix tree (used primarily in string processing for efficiently storing and finding substrings within a larger string. It is particularly useful for tasks such as pattern matching, substring searching, and text compression.)

Red-Black Tree(it is also a tree type dataStucture in this tree it store an additional propertie red / black initial insert it read the next insertion it change to black it also following the bst formulas)
AVL tree (it a self balensing tree  AVL trees are designed to ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced, which helps to guarantee efficient performance for insertion, deletion, and search operations.)
Sparse array (the array is full this type of array is sparse array)
Jagged array (it is 2Dimentinal array the nested arrays are different sizes)
Divide and conquer technique (in quicksort and merge sorts are following this technique,it dived at the most from and merge )
STRUCTURED CLONE( it follow the deep copy mechanism it make a exact copy object )
DEEP CLONING IN JS(it is copy of the main object the coppyed object changes is not affect the orginal 
    eg:- 
        let obj={name:"adil",place:{city:"vga,state:"KL"}}
        let copyObj=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))
)
PROXY OBJECT (it allow to perform intercept and customaization performed the object )
OBJECT PROTOTYPES (it is amechanisem it allow to inherit and method each objects have there own methods 
    it can also possible to make new prototype like this objetname.prototype.methodName=()=>{} // proto:1 like this   
)

DEBOUNCING ( it used to handle the frequantly invocation of a function it limit with a specific interval )
THROTTLING (it also used to limit the invocation of a function with a spesific time after the first click)
