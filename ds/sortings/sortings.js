//sorting means the elements of the array will be arranged in a particular order
//there are five types of sorting
//1. bubble sort
//2. selection sort
//3. insertion sort
//4. merge sort
//5. quick sort

//bubble sort
//bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order
//time complexity
//best case O(n)
//average case O(n^2)
//worst case O(n^2)
